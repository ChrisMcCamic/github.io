<h1 class="font-weight-bold">I Just Watched the movie High Fidelity</h1>
<h3 class="font-weight-light">First time I've actually sat through the whole thing, from beginning to end.</h3>

<a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/blackpink-rose-on-the-ground-gone-solo-interview-9563253/" target="_blank">Only tangentially related to the movie, here's some current music I'm digging on.</a>

<p>OK, this page needs a paragraph, too. What's it going to be about? Well, you know, maybe this here: We all love a movie like High Fidelity, and the comfort it takes in characters contentedly enjoying their own directionlessness.  And apparently, the whole thing is about how this directionless guy's girlfriend dumps him because she's getting her shit together and he's not.  Then, later, he slightly gets his shit together and gets her back. Declare Victory, The End, Roll Credits, because nobody really wants to actually get their shit together anyway, right?</p>
<p>It's a vaguely dissatisfying movie about being vaguely dissatisfied, and I just need more lucidity and... something...from every single character in it, except I still need basically no fucks to ultimately be given, because there needs to be a relaxed, deflated miasma about everything; that's the whole charm.</p>
<p>Except, in actual life, everywhere I have ever experienced the sort of high quality miasma celebrated in this movie, the underlying reality is truly, genuinely depressing.  The perfect balance exists somewhere. It's almost struck, but not quite, in High Fidelity.  Maybe that's more of its charm.</p>
